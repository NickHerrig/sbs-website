# Intro
Welcome to **Shallow Brook Software**!
My name is Andrew Dailey and I'm a software hobbyist in Des Moines, Iowa, USA.
This website is a simple platform for me to document the things I do and the thoughts I have.
I also plan to utilize this as a portfolio for projects that I deem complete and worth showcasing.

# About the name
The name of this site is an homage to the old phrase _"A shallow brook babbles the loudest"_.
I've tried to find a good way to bridge a metaphor between the phrase and my development beliefs but nothing ever really comes out of it.
You could maybe try and link loudness to software complexity, I guess.
I just like the phrase and think it makes for a nice, pleasant name.
I do believe that the steadily increasing complexity of software systems is a real problem for modern projects, however.

I dislike complexity and always strive to implement the simplest possible solutions to the problems I encounter.
I admire the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of designing minimal, modular software.
Coincidentally, I've come to associate simple, minimal websites to focused, powerful, and refined software.
My two primary examples of this are [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/) and [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/).
It's a bit of a weak connection but I appreciate it nonetheless.

# Goals for the site
Programming and learning about various aspects of technology are my primary hobbies outside of work.
Every once in a while I stumble onto something interesting.
Until now, I haven't really had an outlet for presenting whatever the interesting topic was.
I plan to use this site to fill that gap in my desire to express.
There isn't much to say about posting frequency quite yet, but I have plenty of ideas to write about and hope to cover as many as possible.

# Points of interest
I didn't program at all until my freshman year of college at Iowa State University.
At that point, though, I didn't enjoy it very much.
The only programming I did at first was tedious and frustrating because I didn't understand what I was trying to do (not to mention that it was all homework).
It wasn't until I saw [TheChernoProject's Flappy Bird Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=527bR2JHSR0) that I realized how programming can be used to build applications that were fun and exciting.
It shifted my perspective of what programming was from "boring, lifeless, and frustrating" to "exciting, expressive, and fulfilling".

I don't actually program in Java or make games much anymore (though the topic still interests me).
Below is a list of technical genres that _do_ occupy most of my thoughts nowadays.
They are in no particular order and I tend to multiplex between them at any given time.
This list is also not exhaustive by any means.

* Graphics
  * Ray-tracing
  * Rasterization
  * Real-time rendering
  * Software rendering
  * Accelerated rendering (OpenGL / Vulkan)
* Network Programming
  * Programming with sockets
  * Network protocol design
  * Retro protocols (FTP, Telnet, SMTP, IRC, etc)
* Emulation / Reverse Engineering
  * MMO server emulation
  * Retro game system emulation
* RISC-V
  * Assembler design
  * Firmware development
  * Operating system design

# Til next time
Thanks for taking the time to read about my interests and my plans for this site.
I've got plenty of projects and ideas in my personal backlog so feel free to stop by every once in a while.
