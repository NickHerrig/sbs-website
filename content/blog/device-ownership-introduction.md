### Has software gone too far?
30 mil problem  
preventing the collapse  
big nasty complicated systems  
scripts upon scripts  

### A new beginning?
RISC-V plus end of Moore's  
What does it take to make computers work?  
Do we need operating systems?  
What impact will higher-core designs have on CPUs?  
microkernel on one core with apps on the others?  

### I don't have the answers
Just a guy who likes to program  
Some of these skills are uncommon  
What other languages would be viable for bare-metal programming?  
forth, pascal, python lua?  

### simpleriscv
pure-python, cross-platform RV32 assembler  
built with the goal of lowering the barrier to entry for those curious about RISC-V  
want to support all platforms someday  

### Planned devices
Sipeed - Longan Nano  
Sipeed - Wio Lite RISC-V  
SiFive - HiFive1 rev B
