    </header>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Shallow Brook Software</strong>!</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Dailey and I&rsquo;m an independent programmer from Des Moines, Iowa.
I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering from Iowa State University.
I have multiple years of industry experience working a variety of positions including Linux system administration, Python-based ETL, and small-scale cluster automation.
Software development is one of my primary hobbies and I tend to specialize in backend / systems programming.</p>
<p>I am proficient in Python and C and am currently honing my skills with Go and Rust.
When it comes to writing C, I&rsquo;ve spent plenty of time researching and testing the most effective way to achieve simple, cross-platform application builds.
Most of the Makefiles for the C projects on my GitHub reflect this work.
I also enjoy graphics-related programming when I find the time: both rasterization and ray-tracing.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have have a large amount of experience automating tasks with <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">Ansible</a>.
From initializing and setting up new servers to to installing, configuring, and maintaining clustered applications, I&rsquo;ve used Ansible to solve a wide breadth of problems.
I believe that the structure of an Ansible project is the most important factor to keeping things simple, flexible, and effective.
As a result, I&rsquo;ve developed useful strategies for defining relationships between playbooks and roles, delegating variables, and using custom filters to implement dynamic decision-making.</p>
<h1 id="shallow-brook-software">Shallow Brook Software</h1>
<p>The name of this site is an homage to the old phrase <em>&ldquo;A shallow brook babbles the loudest&rdquo;</em>.
I&rsquo;ve tried to find a good way to bridge a metaphor between the phrase and my development beliefs but nothing ever really comes out of it.
You could maybe try and link loudness to software complexity, I guess.
I just like the phrase and think it makes for a simple and memorable name.
I do believe that the steadily increasing complexity of software systems is a real problem for modern projects, however.</p>
<p>I dislike complexity and always strive to implement the simplest possible solutions to the problems I encounter.
I admire the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> of designing minimal, modular software.
Coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve come to associate simple, minimal websites to focused, powerful, and refined software.
My two primary examples of this are <a href="https://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> and <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">libpng</a>.
It&rsquo;s a bit of a weak connection but I appreciate it nonetheless.</p>
