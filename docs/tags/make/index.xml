      <description>A while back, my buddy Wes and I took a weekend trip to a remote cabin in eastern Iowa. We try to do this once a year with plans of fishing, hiking, and simply enjoying the quietness of nature. Not to mention the bliss of having no responsibilities for a few days! Despite being an outdoorsy trip, I still brought my laptop because programming is my favorite hobby. The internet in such remote locations is typically unreliable so I still consider it to be a nice disconnect.</description>
