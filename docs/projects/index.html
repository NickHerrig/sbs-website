<p><a href="https://bloggulus.com">Bloggulus</a> is a &ldquo;meta blog&rdquo; that aggregates numerous other blogs into a single location.
Previously, I had been using a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feeder/">Firefox extension</a> to track my blogs but I wanted something more personalized.
I also found myself spending too much time on <a href="https://bloggulus.com">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://bloggulus.com">Hacker News</a>.
Like many others, I’d even sometimes read only the comments and not the actual content.
That’s definitely a waste of time!
So, I created a website that intentionally lacks a social commenting system and only pulls in posts from the blogs that I trust.</p>
<p>I also wanted an excuse to build something with <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, and <a href="phttp://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/">Peewee</a>.
A special thanks goes out to <a href="http://charlesleifer.com/">Charles Leifer&rsquo;s amazing blog</a> for inspiring me to use these tools together.
Together, they are definitely greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>Bloggulus is hosted on a small <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> droplet (the $5/month one).
<a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> is used as the app&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">WSGI server</a> and <a href="http://nginx.org/">NGINX</a> is deployed as a reverse proxy.
The domain is registered through <a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a> and the TLS cert comes from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>.
Once an hour, an automated process checks each blog&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feed</a> for new content.
All blog posts are stored and indexed in an <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html">FTS (full-text search)</a> table for quick and easy searching.</p>
<p>The frontend portion of Bloggulus is pretty simple.
It is all rendered server-side (via Flask’s <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/">Jinja</a> templating) and styled using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>.
Web design is definitely one of my weaker stills at the moment but practice is the only way to improve!
I intentionally brought together simple colors and hard lines to let the blog posts be the focus.
The color scheme did accidentally end up looking kind of like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon’s</a>, though.</p>

<h2 id="jamql-websitehttpsjamqlcom-sourcehttpsgithubcomtheandrew168jamql">JamQL (<a href="https://jamql.com">website</a>, <a href="https://github.com/theandrew168/jamql">source</a>)</h2>
<p>This project started out as an idea for a way to create Spotify playlists based on a SQL-like query (hence the QL in JamQL).
My plan was to integrate Spotify&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/">Search API</a> with SQLite&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html">virtual table</a> functionality in order to bridge the gap.
I knew that an alternative to using SQLite would be to write my own simple query language and a corresponding lexer and parser for it.
However, I felt like reinventing that wheel wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the trouble and that SQLite&rsquo;s virtual tables would be a perfect fit regardless.</p>
<p>After getting into the weeds a bit, I realized that having users interact with the app purely through a query language wasn&rsquo;t great UX.
Especially on mobile, restricting the interface to one giant text box wasn&rsquo;t very fun <em>or</em> usable.
Instead, I decided to take things in a different direction.
I remembered enjoying iTunes <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/itunes/use-smart-playlists-itns3001/mac">Smart Playlist</a> feature back in the day and wondered if that&rsquo;d be a more viable approach.
So, the current version of the site functions similar to those smart playlists: you can search tracks and create playlists based on a set of filters.</p>
<p>I do plan to circle back to the query language idea at some point in the future.
I&rsquo;d likely take the route of writing my own minimal language as well as a lexer and parser for it.
Since I&rsquo;m still very much a novice when it comes to web design, I want to get the current interation working and looking great before tackling additional ways to jam.</p>

<p>Squeaky is a proof of concept programming language for making games.
It is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> (subset of R5RS) with a focus on writing simple and portable multimedia applications.
The initial goal was to support many features (2D graphics, 3D graphics, and networking to name a few).
However, after achieving the minimal viable product of cross-platform, line-based graphics, I felt as though I had learned enough and made enough progress to wrap this project up and move on.
I plan to study more complex compiler topics such as code generation and executable formats (ELF vs PE) and may return to this project in the future.</p>
<p>Back in college a good buddy of mine took a course on programming languages.
I knew nothing more about that topic than the fact that multiple different languages exist.
I wanted to know more.
How is a programming language made?
Can they even be made?
I thought that programming languages were somehow atomic: unable to be broken down into smaller pieces.
But then my experience with Python taught me something interesting: Python is <em>written</em> in C (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a> is, at least).</p>
<p>That realization truly broke down a big mysterious wall for me.
Programming languages are just programs that read text and do stuff.
Some interpret the text literally while others &ldquo;compile&rdquo; the text&rsquo;s meaning into a leaner, compressed form.
There are many books on language design and implementation.
Some notable ones include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">The Dragon Book</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">SICP</a>.
My fascination with the latter and with game development led to this proof of concept.</p>

<p>One of my earliest memories of being truly amazed by a programmer was first seeing Bisqwit&rsquo;s videos about writing an NES emulator (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71lli8MS8s">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZWw745wPXY">Part 2</a>).
His efficient and straight-forward approach to solving the problem was truly unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever seen.
It was nothing short of incredible.
After seeing his videos I was inspired to get into emulator development myself.</p>
<p>I figured that starting with an NES emulator was bit too zealous and instead looked for something with a smaller scope.
A quick googling led me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a>.
This simple, minimal instruction set is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; of emulator projects.
I was able to scrap together an implementation after a few weeks of iterating.
Despite being technically finished, it had numerous flaws that I didn&rsquo;t really realize until multiple years of C programming later.</p>
<p>For anyone curious, the name Skylark is a reference to the character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kirkpatrick">Chip Skylark</a> from the old Nickelodeon show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fairly_OddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a>.</p>

<p>Assembly programming has always been one of those arcane, fundamental skills that I always attributed to older, wiser, expert programmers who have been writing &ldquo;code&rdquo; since its inception.
I remember thinking how crazy it was that early Pokemon games were written in assembly.
The idea of programming for a specific CPU and set of peripherals sounds pure and unemcumbered.
Sure, you may give up the potential for cross-CPU support but if that isn&rsquo;t a requirement then there is nothing lost.
You might even be able to make better use of your hardware because you don&rsquo;t have to rely on &ldquo;common denominator&rdquo; abstrations.</p>
<p>My desire to learn assembly led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V">RISC-V</a> instruction set architecture (ISA).
The combination of simplicity, newness, and freedom seemed like a perfect fit for a beginner.
I ordered a couple of cheap RISC-V chips and started reading!
My search for a no-frills and portable RISC-V assembler came up short: I really didn&rsquo;t want to fuss with compiling a custom GCC toolchain.
Instead, I wrote a bit of Python to satisfy my very small RISC-V needs.</p>
<p>SimpleRISCV is that project and while correct (as far as I know), it is very bare-bones.
It only supports assembling single files and does absolutely no linking.
The program is simply a RISC-V instruction encoder with a thin layer of label and constant handling above it.
Nonetheless, it helped me get started with the platform and gave me an up-close experience with the ISA.</p>

<p>One of the first topics to really get me interested in programming was real-time rendering.
After completing The Cherno&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=527bR2JHSR0">Flappy Bird tutorial</a> in single sitting, I knew that I wanted to learn more about this interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a> library.
Despite not having a specific use-case in mind, I created this project as more of a sandbox for learning more about graphics.
The Flappy Bird clone was a 2D game and I wanted to take it to the next level: 3D.</p>
<p>Along with being my first introduction to 3D graphics, this project was also my first time programming in C++.
I figured that this was a natural progression since the two languages I&rsquo;d learned beforehand were C and Java.
Many books were read in order to familiarlize myself with all this new content: OpenGL, C++, and CMake (the build system).
After a few hundreds commits I had achieved most of the goals that I set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>I wanted to supporting loading 3D models and rendering in them a decent-looking scene with a skybox.
I wanted a camera that I could fly around the scene and see how the lighting looked from different angles.
Fancy shader effects were also on the menu: reflection, refraction, and bloom.
In hindsight, the design of this project was a bit too presumptuous with its abstractions.
After painting myself into a corner with every attempt at structuring the code, I decided that something was systematically flawed with my approach and transitioned to other programming languages and paradigms.</p>
