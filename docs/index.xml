      <description>Intro Welcome to Shallow Brook Software! My name is Andrew Dailey and I&amp;rsquo;m a software hobbyist in Des Moines, Iowa, USA. This website is a simple platform for me to document the things I do and the thoughts I have. I also plan to utilize this as a portfolio for projects that I deem complete and worth showcasing.

      <description>My name is Andrew Dailey and I&amp;rsquo;m an independent programmer from Des Moines, Iowa. I have multiple years of industry experience working a variety of jobs from Linux system administration to Python-based ETL to large-scale system automation. Programming is my primary hobby and I tend to focus on high-performance, systems software.
I am proficient in Python and C and am currently honing my skills with Go and Rust. When it comes to writing C, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent plenty of time researching and testing the most effective way to achieve simple, cross-platform application builds.</description>
