<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Shallow Brook Software</strong>!
My name is Andrew Dailey and I&rsquo;m a software hobbyist in Des Moines, Iowa, USA.
This website is a simple platform for me to document the things I do and the thoughts I have.
I also plan to utilize this as a portfolio for projects that I deem complete and worth showcasing.</p>

<h1 id="about-the-name">About the name</h1>

<p>The name of this site is an homage to the old phrase <em>&ldquo;A shallow brook babbles the loudest&rdquo;</em>.
I&rsquo;ve tried to find a good way to bridge a metaphor between the phrase and my development beliefs but nothing ever really comes out of it.
You could maybe try and link loudness to software complexity, I guess.
I just like the phrase and think it makes for a nice, pleasant name.
I do believe that the steadily increasing complexity of software systems is a real problem for modern projects, however.</p>

<p>I dislike complexity and always strive to implement the simplest possible solutions to the problems I encounter.
I admire the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a> of designing minimal, modular software.
Coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve come to associate simple, minimal websites to focused, powerful, and refined software.
My two primary examples of this are <a href="https://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> and <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">libpng</a>.
It&rsquo;s a bit of a weak connection but I appreciate it nonetheless.</p>

<h1 id="goals-for-the-site">Goals for the site</h1>

<p>Programming and learning about various aspects of technology are my primary hobbies outside of work.
Every once in a while I stumble onto something interesting.
Until now, I haven&rsquo;t really had an outlet for presenting whatever the interesting topic was.
I plan to use this site to fill that gap in my desire to express.
There isn&rsquo;t much to say about posting frequency quite yet, but I have plenty of ideas to write about and hope to cover as many as possible.</p>

<h1 id="points-of-interest">Points of interest</h1>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t program at all until my freshman year of college at Iowa State University.
At that point, though, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it very much.
The only programming I did at first was tedious and frustrating because I didn&rsquo;t understand what I was trying to do (not to mention that it was all homework).
It wasn&rsquo;t until I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=527bR2JHSR0">TheChernoProject&rsquo;s Flappy Bird Tutorial</a> that I realized how programming can be used to build applications that were fun and exciting.
It shifted my perspective of what programming was from &ldquo;boring, lifeless, and frustrating&rdquo; to &ldquo;exciting, expressive, and fulfilling&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t actually program in Java or make games much anymore (though the topic still interests me).
Below is a list of technical genres that <em>do</em> occupy most of my thoughts nowadays.
They are in no particular order and I tend to multiplex between them at any given time.
This list is also not exhaustive by any means.</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphics

<ul>
<li>Ray-tracing</li>
<li>Rasterization</li>
<li>Real-time rendering</li>
<li>Software rendering</li>
<li>Accelerated rendering (OpenGL / Vulkan)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Network Programming

<ul>
<li>Programming with sockets</li>
<li>Network protocol design</li>
<li>Retro protocols (FTP, Telnet, SMTP, IRC, etc)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emulation / Reverse Engineering

<ul>
<li>MMO server emulation</li>
<li>Retro game system emulation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RISC-V

<ul>
<li>Assembler design</li>
<li>Firmware development</li>
<li>Operating system design</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="til-next-time">Til next time</h1>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read about my interests and my plans for this site.
I&rsquo;ve got plenty of projects and ideas in my personal backlog so feel free to stop by every once in a while.</p>
