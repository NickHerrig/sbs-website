        <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last few days designing and benchmarking extremely minimal pure-Python web servers.
There is a tech myth / superstition that exposing python web servers to the internet is a bad idea but I&rsquo;ve seen little to no evidence as to why this is supposedly the case.
Are they too slow?
Are they too insecure for some reason?
One this is for sure: performance must always be measured, not guessed.</p>
<h1 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h1>
<p>The servers were tested whilst running on a minimal <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> Droplet (1 CPU, 1GB RAM).
All of them are using a TCP listen backlog of 128.
Printing each request to stdout is disabled during the benchmark.
For the actual load testing, I used a tool called <a href="https://github.com/rakyll/hey">hey</a>.</p>
<p>It performs 2000 requests spread across 50 concurrent connections:</p>
<pre><code>hey -n 2000 -c 50 http://bloggulus.com
</code></pre><h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>I started with a load test against <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">NGINX</a> as a baseline.
I then measured all of the other servers in the same way.</p>
<p>RPS stands for &ldquo;Requests per second&rdquo; and latencies are measured in seconds.
The column &ldquo;% NGINX (RPS)&rdquo; is extra cool in my opinion.
It clearly shows how much room for improvement exists within each design.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Pretty interesting stuff!
Some designs were awful, some were middle-of-the-road, and some were decent.
As expected, the simple sequential servers were quite average and all floated around that 50 RPS range.
The <code>forking1.py</code> design was the worst by far.
Spawning a new process per client connection really does add a large amount of overhead.
I&rsquo;m really not sure why it was so much worse than <code>forking2.py</code> which uses Python&rsquo;s builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.ForkingTCPServer">ForkingTCPServer</a> (this supposedly does the same thing).
By watching the actually system processes, the latter didn&rsquo;t seem to be creating a new process for each client as it describes.
I wonder if it has some sort of internal &ldquo;max processes&rdquo; limit to prevent things from getting out of hand.</p>
<p>All of the threading servers did well.
I&rsquo;m not surprised by this given that a web server&rsquo;s workload tends to be very IO-bound.
If the workload was more CPU-bound then I&rsquo;d expect to the threading designs rank a bit lower.
The <code>nonblocking.py</code> and <code>async.py</code> servers also performed well for a similar reason: an IO-bound workload.
These two designs both multiplex the socket IO handling around which clients are ready for action <em>right now</em>.
The two &ldquo;pool&rdquo; designs did decent but not as well as their unpooled counterparts.
The overhead of managing the pool must be coming into play here.</p>
<p>Aside from these numbers, another important design facet is whether or not a particular design allows me to &ldquo;bring my own socket&rdquo;.
Some designs open the listening socket themselves which doesn&rsquo;t play nice with how I deploy my apps into production.
I like to get my privileged sockets (for ports 80 and 443) from <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html">systemd</a> which passes the already listening file descriptors to my app.
Due to this, I need to be able to bring my own socket to whichever design I choose.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I&rsquo;m planning to pick one or two of these designs to take into profiling and optimization.
I really want to see how much closer I can get to NGINX&rsquo;s performance.
I also plan to integrate TLS via Let&rsquo;s Encrypt in a similar manner to Go&rsquo;s <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/acme/autocert?tab=doc">autocert</a> package.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
